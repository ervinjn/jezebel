&emsp The summer rooms of the melkh-banot (king’s daughters) were by the sea.  This fact alone made summer the happiest of times for her in her early years.  And many were the softer, secret moments of the long, hard years thereafter, when those attending to the Queen took her quiet spells for periods of plotting, when in fact, she was walking again on the shores of Ha-yam, a little girl again, and every divine turquoise drop of that heavy expanse of fallen sky was a hidden tear on her cheek.  In the summer, the daughter’s gray winter quarters, high behind the walls of the palace of Tyre, were abandoned for this small, bright, spacious house, only a few short youthful bounds from the surf.  There they enjoyed much greater personal space, sleeping three  to a room, rather than the single room they all shared in the king’s house.   Ayn’noam’s room was particularly to her liking.  She had had to confront or outmaneuver her sisters to lay claim to it.  It was square on the interior end, but on the side that faced the sea it was rounded, in an expansive, graceful arch.  Into this arch were placed long, high, deep-set windows. These had great shudders that she insisted stay open at all times, except, on those occasions of an exceptionally turbulent ocean squall, when the mistress of the house would exercise her authority and overrule the kings oldest.  On most mornings however, when all was still cool, and the sea was still dark and full of thought, the fresh ocean air blew in unopposed.  It was Ayn’noam’s habit to stand then alone, with her open palms pressed on the cool earthen adobe, and drink in thoughts of the far places from which the free breeze came, bringing the smell of salt, and of rain.  And her heart would fill to flowing with the wonder of things, and every small, shining orb of her small spirit would sing to Ba’al.  Then, the thin blue-green curtains would dance around her in the gray light, brushing her legs, her arms, her eyes, her cheek.  And she would finger the many small gems embroidered into them.  These gems she now pressed between her fingers had come to her from the other side of the world, across mile upon mile upon tossing mile of open sea to speak to her of the beauty of creation.  And she listened, silent and still. 

&emsp Still, this was not her favorite time of the day.  That came precisely two hours later, as the top of the eighth hour was struck.  By then the daughters’ train of carriages would be making it way, largely unnoticed by the crowd, taken up with its own business, to the palace of the king.  At the strike of one, the train would just begin to round a great pillar of rock.  And, with each succeeding, resounding strike, the site of the Port of Tyre would come more fully and more powerfully into view.  It’s slow, inexorable revealing never failed to send every fiber of Ayn’noam’s being humming with exhilaration.  By the sounding of the sixth strike, it would be laid out fully before her, so wide that one could, from where she sat in the royal carriage, only half guess through the haze at its far end.  It met her with the breaking of the sun above the desert mountaintops: the great, living, swaying, spraying, breathing, bustling, jostling, calling, crying bay of the ancient seaport of the city-state of Tyre: abode of ships, to which this ancient seat of mercantile greatness owed its entire existence.  The last two strikes were left over to solidify the greatness of what she beheld.  “A ship.  I shall be swallowed by a ship, as if by a great fish.  I shall wrap myself in a wooden cocoon like a caterpillar curling a leaf about itself.  I shall cast myself upon the currents of the sea.  I shall be taken by the winds of fortune.  The power of the earth, ocean and sky shall carry me to god.  It is not idle dreaming. I shall do it.”  Her face beamed with the brightness of these thoughts long after the procession had climbed its swift and steady way into the halls of the kings palace, entrenched high above the bay.

&emsp But the time of her metamorphosis had not yet arrived.  She must bide her time.  And her time was far from entirely her own.  Each minute of each hour of each day of the daughters of the king was the care and command of the royal governess.  No woman held any higher post.  And there was no stricter or more serious overseer.  She commanded the work of a dozen tutors, for whom disregard of her disapproval was akin to drinking poison.  For to fail to prepare the king's daughters was to fail the king, and the king did not, could not, suffer failure.  The daughter's tutors were a sampling of the great cultures of the known world: Hittites, Babylonians, Thebians, Carthaginians.  They taught their charges the harp, flute and instruments of percussion.  They taught them song.  They taught them the crafts of clay and paints.  They taught them elegance and decorum.  They taught them fear of the gods.  And with them came the daughter's male counterparts, young men sent thither from  every direction of the compass, representing their various farflung homelands.  Sons of wealthy merchants and nobles.  Princes. Would be husbands for the daughters of the king.  The stuff of alliances and profitable ventures.  For a princess, the stuff of dreams.  

&emsp Their prospective husbands, however, they would have seen only from a distance, had it not been that the procession of princesses was made to pass by a hall where the young men listened to oratory and engaged in discussions of history, economics, mathematics, religion, philosophy and politics.  And there the governess would have them linger a little.  The purpose was to remind the young charges, male and female, of the point of all of their labors.  So long was the governess wont to have her charges stand in sight of their would be masters, that Ayn’noam began to perceive the sense of the debates, and to find out many of their flaws.  In the evenings, she would argue these points with her sisters, whose main contention tended to be that she should find some other place to sleep.   And so, Ayn’noam would often take both sides of the debate, arguing each in their turn.  It was in this context that she would divine plays, in which her sisters were given the various roles, staying long after dark to write them.  Thus she would satiate her hunger to see the various points and propositions articulated, and their implications drawn out to their conclusions. 

&emsp Ayn’noam’s attentiveness to the debates during the visits to hall of oratory and instruction was not lost on the governess, for she had repeated occasion to draw the eldest daughter away unwilling, often with stern warnings, when the daughters had been observed enough, and the hour called for another appointment.  So insistently, however, did Ayn’noam beg to stay that the governess permitted it much longer than she would otherwise, on the condition that the daughter stay standing for the entire time.  And to increase the power of her play, she dictated that the eldest daughter might only stay and stand if all of the daughters, even the very young, do the same.  This Ayn’noam answered by turning the skills of persuasion she was acquiring on her sisters, whom she convinced, except for a few of her more formidable rivals, to aid her.  Thus, when the youngest among them grew tired, the daughters were convinced, through compromise or compulsion, to take their turns holding them on their shoulders, or in the arms.  This gradually caused sufficient disturbance that the governess relented, relieving the other girls of the duty and allowing Ayn’noam to stay for up to two hours, sitting even, each day listening to the instruction, which she did at the expense of never learning to sew or to dye clothing.  

&emsp Ayn’noam's favorite subject of study was religion.   Indeed, she filtered all other subjects through religion, interpreting them in terms of religious questions and concepts.  And, in her approach to the spiritual, she early developed a preference for mysticism.  For her, the way to  communion with the divine was best pursued not through scholarship, logic and debate, but through art, meditation and ritual.  The mind was a wild and capricious wanderer.  Though ritual expression, be it with clay, chant, or movement, one calmed the chaos and clarified the confusion.  Religion also served as a segue to her study of art and language.  These two were her secondary lovers, and they vied with each other for her attentions.  Their boundaries were diffuse, like clouds that were always at the same time appearing and reappearing, and often crossed each other.  She believed in using language as art, and art as language, and was inclined toward experimentation and innovation.  She appreciated traditional forms, but she placed the greatest emphasis on creativity.  Creation, she believed, was the only truly divine act.  "How it is acceptable to devote one's life to restating what has already been said, using the same forms and constructions.  It is inconceivable."  This private dialog she would deliver with a shake of the head, which, despite the hiding of her hair behind a veil, would never fail to impress at least of few of the boys of the hall as irresistible.  

&emsp	Her learning of language she owed almost entirely to an unlikely teacher in a priest.  It was unlikely because their paths should never have crossed, and because literacy was not a part of the curriculum for the daughters of the kings, nor for his sons, for that matter.  The king's palace has numerous chapels to which the daughters were often taken.  Their interactions with the priests, however, were ritual in nature.  But, on several occasions, the governess decreed a visit to the great temple of Ba'al, at Tyre, located several magnificent blocks from the palace.  This was in a part of the city in which Ayn’noam rarely found herself.  It was on one such occasion that she wandered from the group, and found herself in something of a library: an abode of sacred scribes.  It was there, standing alone and unnoticed, that she was found looking mystified at a clay tablet covered with angular markings.  She didn't know it, but the marks were first set down three thousand years before, and had traveled through 300 miles of desert to arrive before her eyes at the temple by the sea.  Instead of throwing her out, the priest who found her requested that he be allowed teach her to read the tablets.  Against all odds, his request was granted.  He was brought to live in the palace of the king, and to teach the kings daughters how to read the sacred texts.   It was a plum appointment, one that could never had been anticipated, and was perilous, as proximity to power always is.  It would be some time, before Ayn’noam realized how perilous was her own position. 

&emsp Ayn’noam’s presence at the hall of lecture was of course observed by a number of those in attendance.  The young men had taken notice immediately.  Many was the student who took an occasional break from their studies to wonder at what lay behind the veil, aside from skin the color of coffee and cream, and a pair of bright, vanilla-colored eyes.  On the whole, however, her place at an inconspicuous spot at the far back of the hall went completely unacknowledged.  After a few weeks, even the fevered daydreaming of the young men took on a sense of the normal.  The ripples that had at first richocheted from wall to wall across the chamber settled down to a regular background of seemingly self-perpetuating energy: palpable, but contained.  
It was into this stable atmosphere that one day in the midst of the month of Elul, the month of ripening fruit, the chamber was suddenly struck by a thunderbolt.  It came: a storm that, while long anticipated, had been so long delayed that many had given up and ceased to watch out for its arrival.  Their eyes no longer scanned the horizon, or kept attentive for flashes out of the corner of the eye.  They no longer listened for thunder.  No longer felt the way of the wind: it’s direction, temperature, humidity; its liveliness, it’s smell.  Then, on that day, the mountainside that had been quietly rumbling since the sowing of the barley, suddenly, and utterly without warning, collapsed utterly.  Like so many such conflagrations, this one came in the form of a question. “Ayn’a.  What do you think?”  

&emsp The question came from the man who was speaking: a lecturer of history and religion.  It concerned whether Thutmose III had been a god.  It was a favorite debate among those who instructed the young, fraught as it was logical, political and cultural pitfalls.   It required a considerable command of history, analytical ability, and definite ideas about the nature of the spirit of man.  As with so many of the riddles favored by the educated elite, it had no answer, and a thousand answers.  No small number of the instructors relished watching their pupils fall into to the various traps, and thrilled with delight when one of them managed to find some clever word or bit of logic that revealed an opening in the forest, usually a well-worn one that they recognized from years of teaching, or even from their own time as pupils, but sometimes even one they had never considered.  On this occasion, however, the twists and turns of their carefully crafted labyrinth fell entirely out of focus, replaced in the forefront of their minds by the small-framed figure, seated alone and veiled in the back, within the shadow a fold of the architecture.

&emsp It wasn’t that the question was unexpected.  “What are you thinking, daughter of the king, so silent and watchful?”  Indeed, the young female pupil had been the subject of considerable discussion among the tutors ever since she had first come and fixed her piercing gaze upon them as they spoke.  Many of them privately longed to know what was taking place behind those eyes, in this pre-feminine mind.  Some saw her presence as a bizarre eccentricity of the Tyrennian court.  There was an influential camp that saw the idea of bringing this girl out of hiding as an opportunity to place yet another obstacle in the path of their unsuspecting protegees.  "A woman will pin you down with questions.  Make your way out of that young man." Those that were less well connected wondered whether word of his daughter's attendance had reached the ears of the king.  All wondered what would come of it.   If they were not particularly interested in what the daughter of the king thought about Thutmose III, the actually asking of the question, out loud, in the hall of instruction, to the daughter herself, made the air tense as if a storm was at hand. 

&emsp	If the tutors were tensed by the final asking of the question, Ayn’noam was shocked.  No man aside from the king had ever addressed her by name rather than title.  Indeed, the king was the only man to have ever addressed her directly in public at all.  It was wildly disorienting.  She felt strangely exposed, having her name thus spoken, when it had been hidden.  Her male counterparts were equally amazed at the revelation, and many sat wide-eyed.  She slowly focused her mind, repeated the question inside her head, formed a definite opinion, rose to her feet, and fixed her eyes on the questioner.  “This is a question for a fool."  She let the utterance solidify in the minds of her listeners, and in her own.  "And no thing that is not both male and female can be divine.  For no such thing can of its own create a single particle of life."  A sea of expressions stared back at her in amazement.  Then, from somewhere out of a hidden spot nearby, or perhaps out of thin air, stepped a man she didn't recognize.  He wore a priest's robe.  He grabbed her firmly by both arms, then reaching down, removed the veil that heretofore had covered her entire body.  She was barely clothed, standing before a room full of men and boys.  "You are not a woman", the man said.  "And you are not a man.  Perhaps you are a god." Ayn’noam, princess of Tyre, was 11 years old.
